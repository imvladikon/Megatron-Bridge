# Nemotron 3.5 Super VL

Nemotron 3.5 Super VL combines the Nemotron 3 Super language model, including
its MTP layer, with the Nemotron Omni RADIO vision tower and separate temporal
video embedder. The model does not include an audio encoder.

For language-only conversion and reuse of the existing Nemotron 3 Super
recipes, see [the text-only bridge guide](text-only.md).

The functional recipes are defined under
[`src/megatron/bridge/recipes/nemotron_omni/`](../../../../../src/megatron/bridge/recipes/nemotron_omni/):

- `nemotron_35_super_vl_pretrain_config`
- `nemotron_35_super_vl_sft_config`
- `nemotron_35_super_vl_peft_config`
- `nemotron_35_super_vl_sft_long_context_128gpu_gb200_bf16_config`

## Fine-Tuning Freeze Controls

The model provider exposes independent controls for the language model, vision
encoder, and vision-to-language projector. They can be set in a recipe or
passed as command-line overrides.

| Setting | Component | `true` means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model.freeze_language_model` | Language decoder and its language-side weights | Keep the pretrained language component frozen |
| `model.freeze_vision_model` | RADIO vision tower, including its image and temporal-video embedding paths | Keep the pretrained vision component frozen |
| `model.freeze_vision_projection` | Projector from vision features to the language hidden size | Keep the multimodal projector frozen |

The standard SFT recipe intentionally uses:

```text
model.freeze_language_model=false
model.freeze_vision_model=true
model.freeze_vision_projection=false
```

This freezes the vision encoder while updating the language model and vision
projector on image-text or video-text data.

Other useful configurations are:

| Fine-tuning policy | Language model | Vision model | Vision projection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Language only | train | freeze | freeze |
| Language and projector (SFT default) | train | freeze | train |
| Projector only | freeze | freeze | train |
| Full multimodal model | train | train | train |

For example, language-only SFT can be selected without defining another model
provider:

```bash
./scripts/training/train.sh \
  --nodes <nodes> --gpus-per-node <gpus-per-node> \
  --recipe nemotron_35_super_vl_sft_config \
  --mode sft \
  model.freeze_language_model=false \
  model.freeze_vision_model=true \
  model.freeze_vision_projection=true
```

These settings control whether the pretrained base parameters receive
gradients. PEFT adapter placement is a separate concern: `peft.target_modules`
determines which matching modules receive adapters. Freezing a base component
does not, by itself, prevent an unscoped LoRA target name from adding a
trainable adapter inside that component. The H100 and GB200 PEFT recipes use
language-model-qualified target patterns, covering the decoder and MTP while
excluding `vision_model` and `vision_projection`. Custom PEFT configurations
must preserve that qualification if language-only adapters are intended.

## Draft Completion Checklist

- Add verified HF-to-Megatron and Megatron-to-HF conversion commands.
- Add deterministic image and video inference examples.
- Add SFT and PEFT dataset requirements and launch examples.
- Document dynamic-resolution image and temporal-video preprocessing.
- Link the completed page from the Nemotron 3 example index.
